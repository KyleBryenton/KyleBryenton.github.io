    Hi there, I'm Kyle Bryenton!  
    * MSc Physics from Guelph-Waterloo Physicsi Institute
    * Chemical Physics PhD Candidate at Dalhousie University.
    * Member of the Johnson research group.  
    I'm a mathematical, computational, and chemical physicist with a wide array of experience. My current research area is in the development of dispersion corrections within density-functional theory, with applications to surfaces, interfaces, crystal structures, and molecular dynamics. After testing our new formulations on known challenging cases, they will be implemented in open-source electronic-structure codes such as Quantum ESPRESSO and FHI-aims.
