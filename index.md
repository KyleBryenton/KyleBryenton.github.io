## Hi there, I'm Kyle Bryenton.

* MSc, Guelph-Waterloo Physics Institute
* PhD Candidate, Dalhousie University
* Member, Johnson research group  
* Founder, UPEI Mathematics Achievement Program

<div> I'm a mathematical, computational, and chemical physicist with diverse research experience. My current research area is in the development of dispersion corrections within density-functional theory, with applications to surfaces, interfaces, crystal structures, and molecular dynamics. After testing our new formulations on known challenging cases, we will implement them in open-source electronic-structure codes such as Quantum ESPRESSO and FHI-aims.</div>
