## Hi there, I'm Kyle Bryenton.

* Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Johnson Group  
* PhD Chemical Physics, Dalhousie University
* MSc Quantum Materials, Guelph-Waterloo Physics Institute
* Founder, UPEI Mathematics Achievement Program

<div> I'm a mathematical, computational, and chemical physicist with diverse research experience. My postdoctoral research role is supported by an industrial partnership between Draslovka, Dalhousie University's Department of Chemistry, and collaborators at the University of Cambridge. Building on my PhD work in density-functional theory (DFT) method development and testing, my research focuses on advancing Glycine Leaching Technology (GLT) to make mining more sustainable and economical.</div>
