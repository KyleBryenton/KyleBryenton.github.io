## Templates and Tutorials

**[Dalhousie LaTeX/Beamer Template](https://github.com/KyleBryenton/Dalhousie-Beamer-Theme)**

    My Dalhousie University-themed slide template for the LaTeX Beamer class. The `.tex` file has been updated to include interesting showcases and useful examples.

**[XDM Tutorial for FHI-aims](https://fhi-aims-club.gitlab.io/tutorials/xdm-tutorial)**

    Theory, usage, and three tutorials showcasing the Exchange-hole Dipole Moment (XDM) dispersion correction in FHI-aims. The tutorials cover the use of XDM for modelling molecular dimers, periodic systems, and show how to fit and use XDM for any functional/basis combination not already included in the defaults.
